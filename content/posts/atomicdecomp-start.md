Hello everyone and happy new year. I hope you had an amazing holiday season with your family and/or friends.

New year, new project. Since I started in the computer science world I always liked the world of reversing and decompiling. But, I never really understood it. And it is a thorn in my heart. My main experience with reversing was in the Malware Analysis course in the Master's degree in Cybersecurity that I took. And it was a nightmare. Analysing viruses and malware, with all kinds of techniques to hide themselves, is really difficult.

But the day has come. I want to learn and go deeper into this kind of knowledge. After seeing the project https://github.com/isledecomp/isle I thought, why not do something similar but with another game? After checking the Internet (GitHub mainly) and not finding anything, I have decided to analyse and decompile one of the videogames of my childhood, Atomic Bomberman.

Atomic Bomberman is a PC game by Interplay (creators of the Baldur's Gate saga and others) released in 1997.

The source code will be saved in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/atomicdecomp. Once decompiled and functional, I will migrate the source code to current technology, such as OpenGL.

The idea is to learn about reversing, Ghidra, bring this blog to life and do some Twitch streaming from time to time. So, I will start the project on 14 January from 19:00 to 20:00 in Twitch. Stay tunned! https://www.twitch.tv/elraro21/
