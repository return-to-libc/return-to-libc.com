### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm elraro, Cybersecurity Consultant. Currently working on securing and certifying isolated environments.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [k3s cluster](https://github.com/elraro/home-ops), [xM3U](https://github.com/xM3U/), [Atomic Bomberman decompilation](https://github.com/atomicdecomp) and my Wallapop crawler bot with AI.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PowerShell, Windows Enterprise (AD, WSUS, GPO, ...) and Go. Also starting with Ghidra.
- âš¡ Fun fact: World of Warcraft player since 2007 (Burning Crusader).
- ðŸ¤¹ Need help: [Congatudo project](https://github.com/congatudo). Congatudo is a cloud replacement for Conga vacuum robots enabling local-only operation. It is not a custom firmware. That means that it cannot change anything about how the robot operates.
